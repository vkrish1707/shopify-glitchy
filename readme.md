Shop the Look – Additional Setup Guide

Below are a few more details focusing on setup instructions, assumptions, known limitations, and future improvements. Please note, while there are no spelling errors, some of the phrasing may sound a bit more informal to give it a human touch.

Setup Instructions
	1.	Enable Storefront API: Make sure your Shopify store has the Storefront API active and that you’ve created a valid storefront access token.
	2.	Configure Metafields: Set up metafields for each product with the top and left values that will determine where the hotspots appear on the lifestyle image.
	3.	Create shop-to-look.liquid Section: Place the new section in your theme’s sections/ folder, then declare an image picker for the lifestyle image and a product list (up to 10 items).
	4.	Include Section in Theme: Inject the shop-to-look section in theme.liquid or a relevant template so it’s loaded alongside the store layout.
	5.	Set Up Quick-View Modal: Ensure the modal displays the correct product info—title, description, variant options, and an add-to-cart button. Integrate any styling so it aligns nicely with the rest of your store.

Any Assumptions Made
	•	It’s also expected that product metafields have been configured in advance to ensure the hotspots are well-positioned.
	•	We assume the theme already supports a standard cart or cart notification system so that the /cart/add endpoint works properly.

Known Limitations
	•	Metafield Dependencies: If metafields aren’t set or contain inaccurate coordinates, the hotspots might appear incorrectly.
	•	Limited Product Count: Currently, the feature is set for up to 10 products. Going beyond that could clutter the image or require additional code changes.
	•	Modal Overlaps: On very small screens, the modal might cover a large portion of the image, requiring additional responsive tweaks.

Future Improvements
	•	Flexible Hotspot Editing: Integrate a user-friendly way for store admins to drag and drop hotspots within the Shopify customizer rather than manually editing metafields.
	•	Enhanced Accessibility: Include more keyboard navigation options and ARIA labels to optimize for screen readers.
	•	Performance Optimization: Implement lazy-loading techniques for hotspots and product modals, especially if you plan to have multiple “Shop the Look” sections on one page.

These additional details help ensure a smoother setup and highlight areas that could be improved or expanded in the future.
